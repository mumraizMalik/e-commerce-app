Description:
Welcome to the React Fake Store Learning App repository! 🚀

This repository houses a beginner-friendly React application that I've developed for the purpose of learning and honing my skills in React, Redux Toolkit, and useContext. The project showcases a practical implementation of these concepts and serves as an educational resource for those looking to explore React and state management libraries.

Key Features:

Fake Store API Integration: I've integrated the Fake Store API to simulate a shopping experience within the application. This API provides a wide range of products and categories, allowing users to explore and interact with various items.

Redux Toolkit: To manage the application's state, I've utilized Redux Toolkit, a powerful and simplified way of working with Redux. With Redux Toolkit, the application effectively handles the shopping cart and ensures a smooth user experience.

Context API (useContext): For theme management, I've employed the Context API in React (useContext). This allows users to switch between different themes, enhancing the visual appeal of the application. Learning how to work with context provides valuable insights into global state management in React.

Cart Functionality: The core functionality of the application revolves around managing a shopping cart. Using Redux Toolkit, I've implemented features like adding and removing items from the cart, updating quantities, and calculating the total cost of items in the cart.

How to Get Started:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies using npm install.
Start the development server with npm start.
Explore the application and experiment with the various features.
Dive into the code to understand how Redux Toolkit and useContext are implemented.
